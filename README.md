MERN Stack Registration Project

This project demonstrates a Full Stack Registration System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with best practices. The system allows users to register with fields like First Name, Last Name, Mobile Number, and Password. It also includes options for social media login and provides RESTful APIs for CRUD operations.
